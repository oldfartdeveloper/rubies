# Rubies Talking w/ Each Other

I did this project for a semi-lightning presentation to OC Ruby on Jan 30, 2013.

The topic is the challenges and solution for passing information between separate Ruby programs ("rubies").

The audience is Ruby programmers at the beginning/intermediate stage.

I prepared a Mac *Keynote* presentation which is in the `docs` folder.

## Installation

Easy, just clone this repository.

## To Run

```
ruby parent.rb
```

What it does is all explained in the presentation.
